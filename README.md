# CFA CSS Reverse Design Challenge

### Objective
The goal of this challenge was to take an example landing page, without referencing the original, and recreate it with our own CSS file. The purpose was for us to put the grid system in designing pages into practice.

## Result

The end result is a mix of the Get Grav landing page and my own content.

Index
  index.html

Stylesheet
  stylesheet.css 

## Difficulties
Along with this being an intro to our first custom CSS, and bootstrap, we test between flexbox methods as well bootstrap. This helped me understand row, container usage as well as the different column methods between bootstrap and flexbox.

### Plugins

Bootstrap
Bootstrap Sass

### Get Grav
The original landing page was a fairly intense landing page from getgrav.org. The current Grav landing page has since changed.

The original that we referenced is below:
